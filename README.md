## Overview

---

Your task is to take the designs in the listed PSD files and implement them with React/CSS. 

In terms of React Components, you can find everything you'll need inside of `app/components`. The main components you will be extending off of are `Navigation.tsx` and `MyAppointments.tsx`. Both are included in `Layout.tsx` which includes appointment mock data.

- Feel free to make as many additional components as you feel necessary. 
- Organize them as you feel is best.

In terms of styling, you can extend off of the current styles in `styles/main.scss`

- Feel free to use plain css inside of `main.scss`.
- Organize your scss as you feel is best.
- Add any additional scss files inside of the `styles` folder.

**NOTE: make sure they are included in `main.scss` as this is the main file which gets loaded by the application.**
